# The Ranger Client

Ranger introduces a new CLI entry point: certoraRanger.

This command is part of the certora Python package and acts as a lightweight wrapper around certoraRun, 
tailored specifically for bounded model checking. 
It comes with new defaults and additional under-approximations to make finding concrete counterexamples easier and faster.

The certoraRanger client submits jobs to the Certora Cloud, just like the Prover. You'll receive a dashboard link with the results once the job is submitted

# Usage: certoraRanger

# Ranger-specific flags

# Unsupported Prover flags

# Config file compatibility
