Harnessing
==========

Occasionally, CVL lacks a feature that is necessary for a complete verification
of a contract.  We are working to extend the feature set of CVL to cover these
cases, but in the mean time we have developed a set of workarounds that we
refer to as "harnesses".

Harnesses involve systematically altering the behavior of the code being
verified.  They are therefore {term}`unsound`.
