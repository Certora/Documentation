Harnessing
==========

Occasionally, CVL lacks a feature that is necessary for a complete verification
of a contract.  We are working to extend the feature set of CVL to cover these
cases, but in the mean time we have developed a set of workarounds that we
refer to as "harnesses".

Harnesses involve systematically altering the behavior of the code being
verified.  They are therefore {term}`unsound`.


Harnessing by extension
-----------------------

```{todo}
This technique is currently undocumented.  See our [OpenZeppelin verification
project](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/certora) for an example.

Harnessing by munging
---------------------

```{todo}
This technique is currently undocumented.  See our [OpenZeppelin verification
project][oz-readme] for an example.
