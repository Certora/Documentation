Prover Release Notes
=============

```{contents}
```

8.8.0 (February 10, 2026)
-------------------------
### CVL
- [feat] Added a builtin rule, `uncheckedOverflow` that checks whether arithmetic operations can overflow or underflow in `unchecked` code. The analysis is done for each external method and each unchecked operation that is reachable from the method call.
- [feat] Added a builtin rule, `safeCasting` that checks whether any Solidity casting operator can be out of bounds (e.g., whether in `uint16(x)`, is it possible for `x` to be larger than `2^16-1`). Analysis is done for each external method and each casting operation that is reachable from the method call.
- [feat] The `--method` and `--exclude_method` flags now allow providing only the method name (without any parameter types) for EVM. If there are several overloads for this function name, all of them will be matched.
- [feat] New flag, `--assume_no_casting_overflow`, assumes no casting operations in Solidity are out of bounds. E.g., for `int16(x)` in Solidity code, `x` is assumed to be in the valid range of an `int16` when this flag is used. Note that this is an underapproximation, as Solidity does not revert on such out-of-bounds values.

### CI/CD
- [feat] The GitHub action now replaces active reviews within the same configurations.
- [feat] Added GitHub Actions API support for cancelling jobs and refreshing job status. (This will require adding an additional workflow as described [here](https://github.com/Certora/certora-run-action/blob/main/README.md#certora-api-integration).)
- [feat] Added support for [Solana](https://github.com/Certora/certora-run-action/blob/main/README.md#inputs), [Sui](https://github.com/Certora/certora-run-action/blob/main/README.md#-note-installing-the-sui-cli), [Soroban](https://github.com/Certora/certora-run-action/blob/main/README.md#-note-installing-the-soroban-environment) and [Vyper](https://github.com/Certora/certora-run-action/blob/main/README.md#inputs).
- [feat] Improved error logging by GitHub action.


8.6.3 (January 6, 2026)
-------------------------
### CVL
- [feat] Improved invariant base case expressiveness: Previously, storage of all contracts in the scene was assumed zeroed (i.e. all freshly deployed). Now, only `currentContract` storage is zeroed while others may have arbitrary states. To express assumptions about the deployment scenario, the `preserved constructor` block can be applied and now allows stating assumptions about all contracts in the scene. As the scenario checked by default is now more general than before, previously verified invariants may show new counterexamples, requiring adjustment to add such assumptions. The previous behavior can be retained via a new `prover_args` flag `-allContractsZeroedForInvariantBaseCase true`.


8.5.1 (November 25, 2025)
-------------------------
### CVLM
- [feat] Added new Certora Sui Prover (CLI command: `certoraSuiProver`) for Sui smart contract specifications written in the new Certora Verification Language for Move (CVLM).

### CVL
- [feat] Added support for new `preserved constructor()` block for stating assumptions before constructor code is executed when checking the base step of an invariant.
- [feat] Improved VSCode extension's CVL formatting related to unintended line breaks, aggressive empty-line removal, and unnecessary changes to parentheses.


8.3.0 (October 5, 2025)
-----------------------
### Rule Report
- [feat] Imprecisions are now reported as rule notifications and shown in the Call Trace labeled as `IMPRECISION`.

### CVL
- [feat] Wildcard summaries (`_.foo`) now support dispatch lists, allowing users to restrict unresolved calls to a specific set of contracts.
- [feat] Unresolved external calls (`_._`) can now be summarized with `NONDET` or `HAVOC`, in addition to dispatch lists, for more flexible modeling.


8.1.0 (August 11, 2025)
----------------------
### Infrastructure
- [feat] Minimum Java version increased to JRE 19+.
- [feat] Minimum Python version increased to 3.9+.

### CVL
- [feat] `revert` keyword and calling CVL functions with `@withRevert` are now supported, enabling correct reasoning about CVL function reverts when used as summaries.
- [bugfix] Updated `requireInvariant` semantics: invariants are only assumed before a rule starts, fixing unsound assumptions.
- [feat] Re‑routing summaries: allow summarizing internal functions with storage parameters by rerouting to a Solidity harness/library function.
- [feat] CVL formatter: invoke `certoraCVLFormatter <SPEC_FILE> --overwrite` to auto‑format CVL specs.

### Prover
- [feat] Basic sanity checks now run by default, equivalent to setting `"rule_sanity": "basic"` previously.
- [bugfix] Vacuity check for the base case of invariants is now executed.

### CLI
- [feat] Report links generated by the CLI are private by default; use `"url_visibility": "public"` to share publicly. In CI runs, links remain public by default.
- [feat] Foundry remappings support: when `packages` is not set, the tool uses `forge remappings` to resolve package mappings from `foundry.toml`.
- [deprecation] Deprecated CLI options have been removed; update configuration files to use supported alternatives listed in the CLI options docs.
- [deprecation] The `prover_arg` `-adaptiveSolverConfig false` has been replaced by `-backendStrategy singlerace`.

### Solana / Soroban
- [feat] Solana and Soroban verifications must use dedicated commands; `certoraRun` no longer supports these targets. Use `certoraSolanaProver` and `certoraSorobanProver`.


7.31.0 (June 30, 2025)
----------------------
### CLI
- [feat] Added a new `--max_concurrent_rules` flag which allows to control how many rule evaluations are executed at the same time. By default, the number matches the available CPU cores, but lowering the value (e.g., to 1, 2, or 4) can help reduce memory usage and mitigate out-of-memory errors in larger runs.

7.29.1 (May 18, 2025)
----------------------
### CVL
- [feat] `require` statements now support an optional string reason argument: `require(condition, "reason")`.
A warning will be shown in the Rule Notification tab for require statements likely to exclude meaningful traces, helping prevent false positives in verification.

### CLI
- [feat] Added a new `--exclude_method` flag to exclude specific methods when verifying invariants or parametric rules. Syntax mirrors `--method`.

### Solana
- [feat] Jump-To-Source support for Solana function calls in the Call Trace.

7.28.0 (April 10, 2025)
----------------------
### Rule Report
- [feat] Pointer analysis failures now display precise source locations for internal functions in the Global Notification tab. Includes function names and Jump-To-Source links.
- [feat] The Live Statistics panel now supports per-call difficulty metrics for Solana jobs, aiding the identification of complex functions.

### CVLR
- [feat] Solana jobs now support `multi_assert_check`. Each assertion in a rule is verified separately, enabling better counterexample coverage and a timeout mitigation strategy.
- [feat] Solana jobs now support `rule_sanity basic`, which performs vacuity checks to help detect trivially true rules.


7.26.0 (Mar 13, 2025)
----------------------
### Rule Report
- [feat] The Live Statistics panel now supports difficulty information for internal function calls, expanding on the existing support for external and public functions.
- [feat] Jump-To-Source (JTS) is now available for Rust (CVLR) external calls and `cvlr_satisfy`.

### CVL
- [feat] Introduced the `executingContract` keyword, which can be used in the methods block. It refers to `address(this)` at the call site where the CVL summary is applied.


7.25.2 (Feb 19, 2025)
----------------------
### CVL
- [feat] CVL now supports native summation over ghost mapping variables with the new `sum` and `usum` keywords.

### Prover
- [feat] The new `--auto_dispatcher` flag enables the Prover to automatically resolve unresolved calls by looking for matching functions in the scene and invoking them. If no matching function is found, the call will still result in a havoc.

### CLI
- [feat] The new `--split_rules` flag allows users to specify rules that will run in separate instances, reducing the risk of timeouts. Each rule matching the provided patterns runs in its own job with dedicated resources, while all other rules execute in a separate job. The CLI provides a dashboard link to track the status of all generated jobs.


7.22.2 (Jan 12, 2025)
----------------------
### Rule Report
- [feat] Support for displaying numeric values in string, decimal, or hexadecimal formats in Call Trace and Variables tabs, with a dropdown to switch formats.
- [feat] Added call traces and TAC dumps for sanity rules in Rule Report.

### Dashboard
- [feat] Persist column configuration (display selection and width) across browser sessions on the Prover Dashboard, including between tabs and logins.


7.21.1 (December 12, 2024)
----------------------
Various bug fixes and performance improvements.


7.20.1 (November 20, 2024)
----------------------
### CVL
- [feat] Certora’s Foundry Integration lets you run Foundry fuzz tests as formal verification tests. If you already use forge test, you can leverage this integration to formally verify your tests or find counterexamples where they fail. Unlike fuzzing, formal verification provides guarantees for all inputs, not just randomized ones. Note that this integration is in alpha version and requires some CVL configuration.

### Rule Report
- [feat] The Call Trace received a re-design. As part of the re-design, the Call Trace highlights values the Prover found to generate the counter example as gray boxes with tooltips that provides additional information of the semantics of the values. Alongside this change, we also updated the font of the Call Trace. 
- [feat] It’s now easier to navigate to the Call Trace for a rule as the rule tree automatically opens nodes that contain only a single child.
- [feat] Within the Call Trace, we added support for assignments to and loads from Solidity variables, structs and arrays. For assignments to primitive types the Call Trace also displays the assigned value.
- [feat] Prover flags listed in the configuration tab of the rule report now link to their documentation.

7.17.2 (October 8, 2024)
----------------------
### CVL
- [feat] A function can be called on a CVL variable of type address directly. In the following rule, the function `balanceOf` will be called on all contracts that define `balanceOf`:
```
    env e;
    address a;
    assert a.balanceOf(e) > 0;
```
If no contract with such a function exists, a `require(false)` will be inserted, which may cause a vacuity.
- [feat] The Prover now supports verifying code called via proxy contracts. You can specify `extension_contracts` in the `.conf` file to define which contracts are being delegate-called by the proxy.
- [bugfix] The `--rule` filtering now applies also to built-in rules.

### CLI
- [feat] `prover_args` will now be validated locally before submitting the job to the cloud.
- [deprecation] The `typechecker_args` option has been removed. Use the new Python CLI flag `--allow_solidity_calls_in_quantifiers` to allow Solidity calls in quantifiers.
- [deprecation] The `--prover_args` flag  `-adaptiveSolverConfig false` was deprecated. The flag was mainly used in combination with `-smt_useNIA` true to run NIA solvers only. Instead, use: `--prover_args "-backendStrategy singleRace -smt_useLIA false -smt_useNIA true"`.

### Rule Report
- [feat] Additional jump-to-source buttons were added to the Global Notifications, and some existing buttons were corrected. Specifically, buttons for these types of warnings were targeted: PTA failures, optimistic summary fallback fails, `InternalFuncMiss`, storage analysis failures, memory partitioning failures, and `StorageSplitter`.
- [feat] Rule progress indicator: The progress of individual rules will be displayed in the tree view. Each node in the rule tree shows how many children have been completed already.


7.14.2 (September 2, 2024)
----------------------
### CVL
- [feat] Functions can now be called on address-typed variables, allowing methods to dispatch on all contracts that implement the specified function.
- [feat] Added a new `ASSERT_FALSE` summary type to assert that a function call to the summarized function should never occur.
- [feat] Introduced new syntax for summarizing unresolved calls with dispatch lists, offering more precise control over which functions are inlined for unresolved calls. The old syntax remains available but now triggers a deprecation warning.
- [feat] Added `nativeCodesize`, enabling direct access to the result of the `extcodesize` instruction from CVL. It functions similarly to `nativeBalances` in terms of blockchain state comparison and manipulation.
- [bugfix] Hooks are no longer inlined on the `reset_storage` command. This change may affect "induction base" cases for invariant rules that previously relied on implicit hook inlining.
- [bugfix] Explicit casting to `mathint` is no longer required when comparing the result of an arithmetic operation with a non-`mathint` value. Non-`mathint` values are now implicitly cast to `mathint`.

### Rule Report
- [feat] Global Notifications New UI


7.10.1 (July 25, 2024)
----------------------
### CVL
- [bugfix] Make builtin sanity rule also check auto-generated assertions such as unwinding loop unroll assertions.
- [feat] `DISPATCHER(true)` summaries will hard fail on type checking if there is no method in the scene that should be dispatched to.
- [feat] Adding a warning when a contract alias conflicts with a contract in the scene.
- [feat] View functions of contracts *other* than the current contract are now also excluded when checking invariants.
- [feat] It's now possible to compare strings and bytes natively in CVL.
- [feat] The dispatcher list summary now will also inline the fallback handler when using the `Contract._` syntax.
- [feat] Transient storage support in invariants.
- [feat] It's now possible to also write CVL summaries that include structs.
- [syntax check] The usage of the keyword `lastReverted` led to incorrect specifications in cases when the last call was not using the `@withrevert` syntax. During type checking, the CVL parser will now fail and report an error.
- [feat] The dispatcher summary `DISPATCHER(false|true)` has been enhanced to also include fallbacks.
- [feature] There are two new keywords `strong` and `weak` as prefix for `invariant`. A `strong invariant` is a regular `invariant` that will be additionally `asserted` before a havoc’d external unresolved call and `assumed` afterwards. `weak invariant` is an alias for `invariant` explicitly stating that the `invariant` will only hold pre- and post-method execution.
- [feature] It’s now possible to write rules for Solidity functions whose name matches a CVL keyword.

### Rule Report
- [feat] Ensuring storage snippets are shown even if there is no storage layout information.
- [feat] Return statements of CVL functions are now shown in the call trace.
- [feature] Model values for CVL-declared strings are now shown in the Variables Tab of the report.
- [feature] Sanity rules are now explicitly shown as independent nodes in the rule view.
- [feature] The browser tab icon in the rule report now displays the job execution status of a run: blue for running, green when the job has successfully been completed, and red when the job is halted or ends in an error state.
- [feature] Improved display of ghost variable reads in the call trace.

### Performance
- The `-prover_args` option `-smt_easy_LIA` is now set to `true` by default.

### CLI
- [feature] The `—method` flag now also accepts a list of methods.

### Misc
- Supporting precise bytemap semantics (unaligned reads, overlapping, etc.). Disabled by default, can be enabled via `-prover_args "-smt_preciseBytemaps true"`.

- [bugfix] Implication, bi-implication and ternary conditional operators are right-associative
- [bugfix] {ref}`Fully support additional environment fields <env>`. Namely, for `env e`, one can access `e.block.basefee`, `e.block.coinbase`, `e.block.difficulty`, `e.block.gaslimit` and `e.tx.origin`

### CVL
- [feat] Allowing calling Solidity functions from within CVL hooks

- [bugfix] Disallow declaring method variables (aka `method f`; declarations) outside the top-level scope of a rule. They could still be declared as rule and CVL function arguments
- [bugfix] Remove assume/assert notation from `DELETE` summary qualifiers
- [bugfix] Disallow Solidity calls in CVL quantifier bodies
- [bugfix] Support the '$' sign in identifiers (specifically for Solidity functions)

- Declaration of wildcard (i.e. `_`) variable names in rules or rule arguments is disallowed
- Internal summaries - disallow `NONDET` summary on functions returning a pointer, as well as `HAVOC` or `HAVOC_ECF` summaries
- Better checks on ghost axioms, especially if they refer to definitions
- Fixing array literal assignments
- Forbid assignments to array elements, i.e. `uint[] a; a[0] = x;` is disallowed
- Internal summarization did not work in certain tricky cases involving loops and external calls
- Fixing "Certora Prover Internal Error" sometimes appearing when reasoning on complex-typed arrays
- Fixes for structs with contract types as fields

#### Call Trace

- Support for Solidity compiler version 0.8.20 and up


4.5.1 (July 15, 2023)
---------------------

### New features

#### CVL

- Better expressivity: Allow binding the called contract in summaries using `calledContract` (see {ref}`expression-summary`)
- Ease of use: Support reading and passing complex array and struct types in CVL. For example, you can write now:
```cvl
env e;
uint v;
Test.MyComplexStruct x;
uint[] thingArray = x.nested[v].thing;
require thingArray.length == 3;
assert foo(e, x, v) == 3;
```

For the Solidity snippet of a contract `Test`:
```solidity
struct MyComplexStruct {
    MyInnerStruct[] nested;
}

struct MyInnerStruct {
    uint[] thing;
    uint field;
}

function foo(MyComplexStruct memory z, uint x) external returns (uint) {
    return z.nested[x].thing.length;
}
```

- Ease of use: Support access for storage variables whose type is either a primitive, a user defined value, or an enum

- Ease of use: Enum types can be cast to integer types in CVL using the usual `assert_TYPE` and `require_TYPE` operators (see {ref}`cvl2-integer-types`)

- A built-in rule for read-only reentrancy vulnerabilities

#### Call Trace
- Better view of the storage state at storage assignments, storage restore points, and storage comparisons

#### Multi-contract handling
- Improvements to the call resolution fallback mechanism in case main analyses fail, allowing linking and summarizations despite the failures

- Introducing `summarizeExtLibraryCallsAsNonDetPreLinking` Prover option for easier setup of library-heavy code. See {ref}`library_timeouts`

#### Mutation Verifier
- New and easier to use `certoraMutate`. See {doc}`/docs/gambit/mutation-verifier`

### Bug fixes

#### CVL
- Fix issue when CVL functions are invoked within ternary expressions
- Fix evaluation of power expressions such as 2^256
- Make sure CVL keywords can appear as struct fields and be accessible from CVL

#### Performance
- Performance optimizations for the contract preprocessing step
- Performance improvements in Prover
- Performance improvements in CVL type checker (allows for faster job submission)

#### UX
- Show primary contract under verification even when a job is queued but not yet started
- {ref}`envfree <envfree>` checks failures presented not just in rules section, but also in the problems view for highlighting
- Make sure more files generated by `certoraRun` are stored in `.certora_internal`
- Allow equivalence checker to have the same function name appear in two contracts


4.3.1 (July 2, 2023)
--------------------

### New features

#### CVL
- New builtin rules: {ref}`sanity <built-in-sanity>` and {ref}`deepSanity <built-in-deep-sanity>`
- Support a new keyword in CVL: {ref}`satisfy <satisfy>`
- User-defined types can appear in hook patterns
- Support using `currentContract` in ghosts and quantified expressions
- Support conversion of `uintN` to `bytesK` with casting {ref}`bytesN-support`
- Support {ref}`nativeBalances <special-fields>` in CVL
- Making access of user-defined-types (enums, structs, user-defined type values) in Solidity consistent, whether those types are declared in a contract or outside of a contract. Specifically, for a user-defined type that's declared in a contract, the access to it in a spec file is `DeclaringContract.TypeName`. For top-level user-defined types (declared outside of any contract/library) the access is using the using contract `UsingContract.TypeName`.
- Support for {ref}`EVM opcode hooks <opcode-hooks>`

#### CallTrace
- Display CVL functions in Call Trace
- CallTrace presenting skolemized variables for quantified expressions
- Gather all setup labels in CallTrace to be under one label
- Make CallTrace accept invocation of internal solidity functions from CVL

#### Summarization
- Early summarization of internal functions for improved performance and precision
- {ref}`“catch-all” summaries <library_timeouts>`. For example, given a library `L` on which we wish to apply the same summary for all external methods in `L`, write `function L._ external => NONDET`

#### Performance
- More stable generation of formulas for more predictable, consistent running times of rules
- Basic parallel splitting for improved running time of rule solving

#### Other improvements
- Change default to new `certora-cli` API
- Check for an invalid rule name (given with `--rule`) locally, before sending a request to the server
- Adapt CVL AST serialization to JSON to enable LSP for CVL2
- Visualize unsolved splits in timeouts

### Bug fixes
- Warn if `CONST` summary is applied to methods that return nothing
- The type checker will fail if an internal method summary uses an inheriting contract name instead of the declaring contract name
- Disallow shadowing of ghost variables
- Support exists as a struct field in spec files
- `require_` and `assert_` casts disallowed in ghost axioms
- CallTrace bug fixes
