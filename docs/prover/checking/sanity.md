Rule Sanity Checks
==================

The {ref}`--rule_sanity` option enables some automatic checks that can warn you
about certain classes of mistakes in specifications.

```{note}
The `--rule_sanity` option is different from the {ref}`built-in sanity rule <built-in-sanity>`
```

```{todo}
This section should be expanded.
