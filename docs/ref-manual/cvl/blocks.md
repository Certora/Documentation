```{todo}
This section is incomplete.  See [the old documentation](/docs/confluence/anatomy/commands).
```

(havoc-stmt)=
### The `havoc ... assuming` statement

```{todo}
This section is incomplete.
```

```{todo}
Be sure to document `@old` and `@new`.  They are not documented in {doc}`expr`
because I think `havoc ... assuming ...` is the only place that they are
available.
