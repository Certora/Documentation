Introduction
============

This Reference Manual contains detailed and comprehensive information about the
Certora Prover.  The Reference Manual is intended to describe what the Prover
does, in contrast to the {doc}`/docs/user-guide/index` which explains how to
use the Prover to accomplish particular goals.

```{todo}
This documentation is currently undergoing significant reorganization and
editing.  Some of the pages are missing; where possible we have included
pointers to the {doc}`/docs/confluence/index` on given topics.
