Understanding Counterexamples
=============================

Warm-up Exercise
----------------

Start with [Ball Game](https://github.com/Certora/CertoraProverSupplementary/blob/master/Tutorials/Lesson2/BallGame/BallGame.sol), implementing a ball game with four players. Player 1 passes the ball to Player 2; Player 2 passes back to Player 1. Player 3 and 4 pass to each other. The ball starts at Player 1. Let's prove that the ball can never reach player 4.

*   Run:
    
    ```bash
    certoraRun BallGame.sol --verify BallGame:BallGame.spec 
    ```
    
*   Understand the counter-example
    
*   Fix the rule to avoid superfluous initial states
    

We learn here that to prove the required property, we needed to prove a stronger invariant.

Realistic Exercise
------------------

[Manager](https://github.com/Certora/CertoraProverSupplementary/blob/master/Tutorials/Lesson2/Manager/Manager.sol) implements transferring of a management role of a fund. It is a requirement that an address can manage at most one fund. Let's try to prove this property.

[Manager.spec](https://github.com/Certora/CertoraProverSupplementary/blob/master/Tutorials/Lesson2/Manager/Manager.spec) contains a typical parametric rule `uniqueManagerAsRule`.

*   Run:
    
    ```bash
    certoraRun Manager.sol --verify Manager:Manager.spec 
    ```
    
*   Understand the counter-examples.
    
*   Understand which additional properties are related and need to be proven together.
    
*   Fix the rule.
    
*   Check your rule as sometimes the rule is too strict, it limits the possible initial states or executions too much:
    
    *   Insert bugs to the code that you believe should be uncovered and re-run Certora Prover
        
    *   Run on [ManagerBug1](https://github.com/Certora/CertoraProverSupplementary/blob/master/Tutorials/Lesson2/Manager/ManagerBug1.sol) and [ManagerBug2](https://github.com/Certora/CertoraProverSupplementary/blob/master/Tutorials/Lesson2/Manager/ManagerBug2.sol)
        
        To run on those files:
        
        ```bash
        certoraRun ManagerBug1.sol:Manager --verify Manager:Manager.spec --msg "check for bug"
        certoraRun ManagerBug2.sol:Manager --verify Manager:Manager.spec --msg "check for bug"
        ```
        
        Did your rule find violations?
