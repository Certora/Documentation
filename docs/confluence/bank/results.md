Understanding the Results of the Certora Prover
===============================================

The Certora Prover produces a table with the verification results as a web page. For each rule, it either displays a thumbs-up if it formally proved the rule or displays an input that triggers a violation of the rule. For example, below is a violation of the rule `others_can_only_increase` when simulated on the transfer function. A call trace demonstrating the violation is shown. It shows the arguments passed to each simulated function and the resulting return value (displayed after the slash). This example shows that a transfer of an amount close to `MAX_INT` causes the balance of the recipient account to decrease.
