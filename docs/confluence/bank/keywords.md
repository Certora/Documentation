Standard identifiers
--------------------

CVL language includes the following standard identifiers: 

*   `bool lastReverted` - true when the last function call reverted, for example “did the transfer revert?”. Note that it can only return true if the last function was marked with `@withrevert`.
    
*   `address currentContract` - the address of the current contract that is checked, e.g. the address of `Bank`.
    
*   `storage lastStorage` - The current state of the contract. Useful for enforcing hyperproperties of smart contracts.
    

```cvl
rule transfer_reverts() {
  // A rule with two free variables:
  //     - to - the address the transfer is passed to
  //     - amount - the amount of money to pass
  address to;
  uint256 amount;
  env e;
  // Get the caller's balance before the invocation of transfer
  uint256 balance = getFunds(e.msg.sender);
  // invoke function transfer and assume the caller is w.msg.from
  transfer@withrevert(e, to, amount);
  // check that transfer reverts if the sender does not have enough funds
  assert balance < amount => lastReverted , "insufficient funds";
}
```
