# Some Background on Timeouts in Certora Prover

In this section, we will discuss some background of timeouts happening in the Certora Prover.
We try to answer questions like "Why do you build a tool that times out?" and "Will there be an automatic program verifier that never times out?".
For more practical advice on timeout prevention, please consult the other parts of our documentation on [managing timeouts](index.md).

We are going to focus on SMT timeouts.

This section still needs to be written.

%, since SMT solvers are designed to solve problems that, according to theoretical computer science, are prone to showing "exponential" runtime behavior or worse.
