Managing Timeouts
=================

```{todo}
This chapter is incomplete.  The old documentation has a section on
{doc}`troubleshooting </docs/confluence/perplexed>` that addresses timeouts.  There
is also some helpful information in the section on
{ref}`summarization <old-summary-example>`.
Some of the information in these references is out of date.
```

```{todo}
See {ref}`sanity <built-in-sanity>` and {ref}`deep sanity <built-in-deep-sanity>`
rules can be helpful in identifying timeouts.
```
