```{todo}
This documentation is incomplete.  In the meantime,
see [Lesson 1 of the tutorial][lesson]
for a detailed walkthrough of how to write a basic property, verify it using
the Certora Prover, and understand the verification results.

Feel free to post questions at [forum.certora.com](https://forum.certora.com).
```

```{todo}
The built-in rules {ref}`built-in-sanity` and {ref}`built-in-deep-sanity` can
be useful early in a project.
