Running out of Time or out of Memory
====================================

In this chapter, we describe how to diagnose and remedy when the Certora Prover
ran out of time or out of memory.

% Unfortunately, the Certora Prover regularly encounters issues it can not resolve
% and fails in some way or another. A job may run out of time or memory, or hit a
% variety of further issues so that it is shown as "Problem". Even a job shown as
% successfully finished may have problems in the "Global Problems" view at the
% bottom of the web report.
% The "Job Info" page provides the "Logs page", essentially the log file of the
% Certora Prover.
% For experienced users, the "Status page" contains the download link for a zip
% archive that contains all the Certora Prover output, including further log files
% and dumps of intermediate code.
