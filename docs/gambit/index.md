Gambit: Mutation Generator for Solidity
=================================

This chapter describes how Certora uses ideas from
mutation testing to evaluate and improve CVL specifications.

Mutation testing is a technique for evaluating and improving
  test suites.
The key idea is to randomly mutate the program to potentially
  introduce faults and then running the test suite on the "mutants" ---
  if the test suite "kills" a large percentage of mutants,
  that is an indication of a "good" test suite.
Mutants that pass the tests are often used as a guide to improve the
  test suite by adding more tests.

At Certora, we use mutation testing to evaluate and
  improve formal specifications used in automated verification.
We built [Gambit](https://github.com/Certora/gambit),
  an open-source mutation generator for Solidity.
We then use the mutants generated by Gambit to assess the CVL specifications
  written for a verification task.
Gambit is a general-purpose mutation generation tool that can be used with many
kinds of verifiers or testing tools.  {doc}`gambit` describes how Gambit can be
used to generate mutants for use with any tool; while {doc}`mutation-verifier`
describes how to use Gambit with the Certora Prover to evaluate specifications.
